# NEXT: what "go" does next

The user says "go"; Claude does the whole step below, piece by piece (one
commit each, tagged), deploys once, then rewrites this file for the step after.
How: `CLAUDE.md`. The engine: `docs/ENGINE.md` (E1-E9, built). **The plan
now: `docs/STUDIO.md`** (the Studio, the hub as the Dials, the new look;
steps S1-S10).

## Where we are (2026-10-21)
- The engine plan E1-E9 is built and live (`22e9b28`).
- The user is phone-checking it (the list in the chat). Any "broke <piece>"
  is fixed first, before the step below (CLAUDE.md → Pinpointing breakage).
- The Studio plan, step by step: S1-S6 done (2026-10-22), S7 next. Checks: per piece only its own test, the full check once per step (user). The user
  picked the **Faceplate** theme (the others stay switchable).

## The next step: S7, light and look (docs/STUDIO.md §5.6, §8)
- [ ] **S7.1** Materials as data (`assets/world/materials.json`: the 13 built-in ones move there, the engine reads them) + a material editor in the Studio (colour, roughness, metal, glow). *Check:* make a "blue velvet" material, give it to the sofa.
- [ ] **S7.2** Lights: colour, brightness, reach, softness, dims, live in the Studio; their loops; reflections recaptured after. *Check:* make the neon by the arcade red.
- [ ] **S7.3** Moods (named light sets: Evening, Party, Closing) and the budget meter (draws, triangles, lights against the phone's limits). *Check:* switch Evening → Party in the Studio; the meter stays green.

## Waiting on the user: P1, the engine phone check
- [ ] **P1.1** Fix every "broke" the user reports (one commit each, tagged with the piece it fixes).
- [ ] **P1.2** A `?perf=1` report in the busy part of the bar (by the fire, the mirror in view): compare with E2's 63H3FJ (16.7 ms avg); if reflections or shadows cost more than 1 ms, make them cheaper.

## Done before (details in git and docs/ENGINE.md → Progress)
E1-E2 (core, the bar as things), E3.1-E3.7 (touch, seats, jukebox, darts,
late joiners, mirror), E4.1-E4.4 (precise touch, shadows, smoke,
reflections), E5.1-E5.2 (idle life, smooth poses), E6.1-E6.2 (sounds),
E7.1-E7.4 (boxes, the test home, travel, catalog), E8.1-E8.2 (the hub's World
page, tuning), E9.1-E9.2 (projects as a part, old keys gone).

## Build log (newest first: build code → what → commits; "undo" reverts one row)
- (this push) S5.1-S5.4, S6.1-S6.4: precision (magnifier, part mode, this one / every one, Inspect edits everything) and building (Library with pictures and prices, duplicate / row / rename / delete, boxes with push-pull and extrude, places) → f3a2dc4..HEAD
- `f3a2dc4` S4.1-S4.4: the hub as Needs you · Dials · Board · News, tuning baked into the world, the bar's menus, news and loading screen in Faceplate → 8797ac4..f3a2dc4 (with the room's grace fix and S5.1)
- `8797ac4` S2.1-S2.5, S3.1-S3.5: the Studio opens (login, cameras, picking, the Monitor, X-ray) and edits (Move/Turn/Size, slide, Drop, Put on, undo, the draft, Publish, History, Restore) → 5a04c79..8797ac4
- `5a04c79` S1.1-S1.6: the theme system (/ui), the front door, the schema, the world store, the bar and the room load the live world, studio.mjs → 988d71f..5a04c79 (world v1 published after)
- `22e9b28` E8.1, E8.2, E9.1, E9.2: the hub's World page and live tuning, projects as a part, old keys gone → fa64f17..22e9b28 (66526ef was the same game; 22e9b28 only fixed a test)
- `fa64f17` E3.3–E3.7, E4.1–E4.4, E5.1–E5.2, E6.1–E6.2, E7.1–E7.4 → e807e99..fa64f17
- `ff60ac4` E3.1, E3.2, E3.6 (half): touch things, the room runs their rules → a2fe850..HEAD
- `a2fe850` E2 done: the bar as a place file, every object alive (before this file existed).
